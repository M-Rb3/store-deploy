## Deployment

This is a [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) app and a fork of [NEAR Discovery](https://github.com/near/near-discovery) gateway app.

For static exports just run `next build` and upload the build files to your hosting provider. More info [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports).

For Vercel, Cloudflare or others that supports a Next app just connect the repo and follow the deploy steps from the dashboards.

More info on Next.js deployments [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports).

## Running with docker

```bash
docker build -t store-deploy .
docker run -p 3000:3000 store-deploy
```
